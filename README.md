streamwatch
===========

A simple web page that allows simultaneous watching of multipleinformation
sources in a Google+ stream-like style. This app was created for the I/O
Extended Event in Aachen, Germany. It is inspired by [Gerwin
Sturm](goo.gl/xsMuK)'s [Hangout Comment Tracker](goo.gl/uBXnS) and built using
the [Google Closure Tools](goo.gl/O9sx2).

Most of the rendering code was originally developed for the [Favorite Posts for
Google+](goo.gl/4werF) Chrome Extension, thus strongly resembling the look of a
Google+ stream.
